    <!-- we have made these two in diffrent files beacuse the DOM is only used for webdevlopment and the create element one is used in diffrent apps like react native , and other react apps which are used by the devlopers also it reduced the file size by braking in two peices and these are hosted over the content delivery newtwork called CDN .  -->

    <!-- the cdn manages and delivery the static data to the user whenever required and these are small servers unlike the main server . the main server hold the dynamic data like comments , likes , views etc but the video is stored in cdn from main server and whenever any user required if the cdn has the video it delivers and else it request from main server and then it stores inside him for any other user and this is the usecase of the youtube app   -->
