WHAT IS TRANSILER ????
ANS-> the typescript is act like a comiler as it coverts the code into javascript code but its name is changed beacuse it just like translate the language with some checks so we call this as the name "TRANSPILER"

JAVASCRIPT uses JIT (just in time) compiler !!
-> the jit is act like intrepeter meaning it take the code line by line and convert it into machine code and then give it to the cpu for execution but when it sees a repeted component or a function then it uses the previously genrated machine code for that program , this reduces the execution time of the program or code 


We can create the type{

} only once but in the infrence we can use the same name to declare another key component in it
